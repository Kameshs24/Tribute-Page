        <h4 id="infoHeading">The 10 Best Robert De Niro Movies of All Time, Ranked</h4>
        <ul id="points">
          <li class="text"><b>Goodfellas</b> (1990) - Goodfellas is a timeless masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences with its exceptional screenplay, stellar performances, and visionary direction. </li>
          <li class="text"><b>Taxi Driver</b>(1976) - Robert De Niro worked fifteen hour days for a month driving cabs as preparation for this role. He was still rather unknown then but had just won his Oscar for The Godfather II and was recognised just once by a passenger he picked up who was also an actor himself.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>Once Upon a Time in America</b>(1984) - Once Upon a Time in America is a tremendous work that captures the animating ambition and sorrow at the heart of the American Dream.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>The Godfather: Part II</b>(1974) - Although The Godfather Part II did not surpass the original film commercially, it grossed $47.5 million in the United States and Canada. and was Paramount Pictures' highest-grossing film of 1974, and the seventh-highest-grossing picture in the United States.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>Raging Bull</b> (1980) - Arguably Martin Scorsese's and Robert De Niro's finest film, Raging Bull is often painful to watch, but it's a searing, powerful work about an unsympathetic hero. </li>
          <li class="text"><b>The Irishman</b>(2019) - Amazing acting, great story lines and some twists. Loved how the story was told through the eyes of De Niro's character as he was at the end of his life. For anyone that likes gangster movies, it is worth a watch - high quality actors from across the great gangster films.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>Heat</b>(1995) - This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>Killers of the Flower Moon</b>(2023) - While "Killers of the Flower Moon" may not be the best film Scorsese has ever made, it is well-made. For those who know the story, I think you will find the movie does it justice. For any cinephiles out there, this is your kind of movie.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>Jackie Brown</b>(1997) - Jackie Brown marks the only time Quentin Tarantino and Robert De Niro worked together, but at least it proved to be a memorable collaboration. The film's a darkly comedic and very stylish crime/thriller, largely centered around a flight attendant who gets caught smuggling cash for a gun runner and finds herself forced to collaborate with the police.</li>
          <li class="text"><b>The Deer Hunter</b>(1978) - So Heartbreaking, So Sad, So Accurate, So Brilliant. Outstanding and haunting Best Picture winner of 1978 that still packs a punch nearly 25 years later. Robert DeNiro (Oscar-nominated), Christopher Walken (Oscar-winning for Best Supporting Actor) and John Savage are on their way to fight for their country in Vietnam.</li>
